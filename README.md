Upgrades to Ender5

I am upgradeing my classrooms Ender 5 and trying to catalog these upgrades for several reasons.
1. So that I can easily ask for help - I am still learning and need help from all of you.
2. So that I can keep track of everything I am doing.
3. To share what I am learning with others.
